    "In the context of the numerical solution of ordinary or partial diffential equations, the second more significant approximation comes from that the computer resources are limited. From the physical point of view, both time and space are continuous variables, but continuous data does not exist in the numerical world, as it would require infinite computer memory. Therefore, continuous variables are approximated using a discrete representation. For that purpose, we can for example introduce grid points at which the functions are evaluated. A small grid spacing results in a higher accuracy, but it comes at a higher computational cost. Some balance always has to be found.\n",
